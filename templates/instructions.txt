Want to add a template? If the template is your own work and you are willing to license it under Creative Commons, please make a pull request.

[list][h3]How to Add a New Template[/h3][*]Place your templates in the [b]templates[/b] directory in the most relevant folder. The subdirectory you choose is up to you. No good match? Add your own subfolder and put it in there.
[*]In [b]templates/index.json[/b], find the category your template best fits under, usually the department. If you're adding a set of record skeletons, put them under a group in "Records" with your name instead so that they're grouped with similar templates. Add a new element where it's most appropriate.
[*]Make sure the new JSON is correct. You can test in Microsoft Edge (doesn't prevent you from accessing local files via AJAX) or just paste the contents into jsonlint.com to validate.

[center][h2]Formatting:[/h2][/center]

table - for arranging tabular data, checklists, or other forms

[table][row][cell][cell]B1[cell]C1
[row][cell]A2[cell][cell]C2
[row][cell]A3[cell]B3[cell]
[/table]

grid - just a table without borders, useful for columns or less cluttered forms

[grid][row][cell][cell]B1[cell]C1
[row][cell]A2[cell][cell]C2
[row][cell]A3[cell]B3[cell]
[/grid]

list - does what it says on the tin. You can also use it for its header element if you really need an indent, I guess.

you[br]don't[br]need[br]to[br]use[br]these[br]anymore,[br]line[br]breaks[br]work[br]just[br]fine by themselves, but paperwork sure was hellish back when you needed one of these on every line break.

hr - makes a pretty line at the tag and leaves a space underneath, so you probably want an extra line break above one to make it look balanced:
